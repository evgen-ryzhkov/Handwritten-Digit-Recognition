# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Random Forest Classifier with ~97% accuracy

Recognizing digit by inputting image with handwritten digit.

## The Goals
    Familiarity with multi class classifier on practice and experimenting with:
    - creating different synthesis data to training data set
    - increasing model accuracy by searching best parameters and adding synthesis data
    - recognizing of digits from the image

## Notice
   scripts/final_model.7z - it's the saved final model and it need to uncompress into scripts directory.
