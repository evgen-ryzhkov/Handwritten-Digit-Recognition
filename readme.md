# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Random Forest Classifier with ~97% accuracy

Recognizing digit by inputting image with handwritten digit.

## The Goals
    Familiarity with multi class classifier on practice and experimenting with:
    - creating different synthesis data to training data set
    - increasing model accuracy by searching best parameters and adding synthesis data
    - recognizing of digits from the image
